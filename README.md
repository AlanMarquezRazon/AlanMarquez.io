# Work Experience 
* **Post-Doc Researcher** under David Hyde, **Vanderbilt University** Department of Computer Science **2022-2023** Investigation of the use of the material point method (MPM) for sharp interfaces. Expand the utility and applicability of MPM to real-world problems. Physical interfacial problems from physical science and engineering.
*  **Software Engineer** under Theodore Gast, **Jixie Effects 2022** Develop Material Point Method software and material models for multiphysics simulations.
*  **Graduate Student Researcher** under Joseph Teran, **UCLA Department of Mathematics 2020-2021** Investigation of the use of the material point method (MPM) for fluid-structure simulations. Support of the in house codebase, develop and implement a wide variety of C++ functions including level sets, fast sweeping algorithm, hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian methods for fluid simulation, surface tension for MPM, conservative transfers for MPM and hybrid method for collisions using finite elements and MPM.
* **Graduate Student Researcher** under Oddvar Bendiksen (retired) **UCLA Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 2016- 2017** Investigation: Aeroelasticity benchmark work for the next generation of high transonic and supersonic aircraft. This included CAD modeling for a wing tunnel model. Validating finite elements to appropriate model the wing tunnel model in the experiment, coding and comparing the data to experimental results.
* **Aerospace Engineering Intern** under James Lewis **California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory 2015-2016** Support the Mars Oxygen IRSU Experiment (MOXIE). Focusing on the flow processes and instrumentation systems. Handled CAD modeling using SOLIDWORKS, equipment maintenance, inventory, and 3D printing of the MOXIE prototype.
